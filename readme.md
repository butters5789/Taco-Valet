How do you feel?

* Right after the hackathon we felt stressed but wired. Now that some time has passed we feel proud of what we accomplished, and impressed with how we accomplished it in such a small amount of time.

What did you think would be easy (but wasn't)?

* Git was definitely more difficult than we anticipated. We thought pulling would be easy, but we ended up taking a lot of time to get synched up and we definitely ended up deleting and re-pulling the repo a few times.

What did you think would be hard (but was easy)?

* We thought getting the voice API to work would be fairly straight forward. However, we started working with the wrong api, which consumed a fair amount of time. Once we found Google Speech rather than Google Voice everything was smooth sailing again.

What techniques did you successfully utilize to work in a team?

* We met as a team a lot and were constantly communicating with each other while we were working. We tried to divide the tasks out by what we felt the most confident at. In the end it seemed like we basically working in pairs, which maybe should have been the way to start.

What wasn't useful to work in a team?

* In a longer term project we think wireframes are very important. In our time crunch hackathon mad dash, we ended up writing wireframes and completely ignoring them. We also had quite a few times where we were waiting on someone to finish a feature so we could push/pull and continue working on our own parts.

What would you change to work in a team?

* I wouldn't change much. I think we were very successful in taking on a task and accomplishing it. Team work takes a lot of coordination and more planning time could have produced an even better project.

What were the road blocks to working successfully in a team?

* We had to really talk through issues and make sure tasks were delegated. There were some bottlenecks where people couldn't work until someone else was done. In those instances we would pair program to help with issues, or we would leave them alone to work until their task was completed.

What did you learn?

* We learned the google speech api has the word Quesarito. Also, we learned that we can accomplish a lot in a small amount of time as long as we don't care what the code looks like.

What did YOU kick ass at?

* Cooper - Google speech API
* Brad - Project management and leadership
* Courtney - Front end / design
* Nate - Vanilla JS and parsing strings

What is "going into your learning queue"?

* We all learned a lot about Express and routing.  We also learned some what not to-do's with GIT.

How did you project scope change?

* There were some scary times when the voice API wasn't working, and we almost reduced the scope of our project. In the end we managed to accomplish what we originally planned, so it didn't change much.
